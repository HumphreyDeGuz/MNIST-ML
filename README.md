# MNIST vs ML

Repository of files used for a report on the MNIST problem along with several machine learning algorithms used to tackle them, comparing their performance. We also use a real world sample of hand written digits to see how the models compare. The models used are Log-Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and a modified version of LeNet. More can be read under the `HandwritingFinalReport.pdf`
